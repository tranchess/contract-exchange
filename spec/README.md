# Architecture

Tranchess Protocol is a platform for crypto-backed synthetic assets capable of speculating, hedging, and arbitraging with minimal liquidation risk, settlement risk, and other systematic risks. In our approach, it consists of two major components: the primary market and the secondary market.

Tranchess Exchange Protocol is the set of contracts representing the secondary market. Since the tokenized shares could experience conversions, which are essentially linear transformations upon all account balances, no existing swaps or centralized exchanges are readily available for trading shares. As a result, we set off to design our exchange for liquidity. In the secondary market, both the stablecoins such as `USDC` and tokenized shares could be exchanged using a matching mechanism we refer to as **Premium-Discount Orderbook**.

In our approach, trade activities are divided into the same 30-minutes period as the Oracle Protocol, and the exact trading price could not be determined at the trading time, because the price oracles are still subject to change. Instead of a fixed price, the makers need only to specify a certain percentage for an order. The percentage is relative to the net asset values calculated in the future, with a positive percentage known as **Premium** and a negative percentage known as **Discount**. Similar to a traditional exchange order book, the smart contracts also arrange orders in order books from the highest to the lowest percentage forbidding order, and lowest to highest for asking order. We've achieved a few goals with this design:

1. Conversions do not affect trading activities
1. Low cost for liquidity providers to interact with the blockchain
    1. No impermanent loss, because it is not using AMM
    1. No high-frequency order submission and cancellation, because premiums and discounts fluctuate with the price
1. The exchange operates completely on-chain

# Contracts

## Staking

The [`Staking`](../contracts/Staking.sol) contract stores tokenized shares and makes them available for exchange and rewards. Each `Staking` corresponds to 1 instance of `Reward`, 1 instance of `Fund`, and thus 3 instances of the `Share` token contract. It accepts deposit or withdraw requests from one of the `Share` token, and accumulates the rewards with the help from `Reward`.

In addition, it keeps the history of the global integral, âˆ«(rate \* balance / totalSupply dt) from the last Conversion till checkpoint, the most recent per-account integrals, and per-account claimable rewards. It is invoked whenever deposits are changed and accumulate the rewards for the accounts involved.

1. Deposit Token P/A/B
1. Withdraw Token P/A/B
1. Claim rewards

## Exchange

The [`Exchange`](../contracts/Exchange.sol) contract is the main entrance to all secondary market functionalities. Each `Exchange` maintains three pairs of ask and bid order books, facilitates trades, and temporarily holds the stablecoin and tokenized shares before they have been claimed by users.

1. Place bid orders
1. Place ask orders
1. Fill bid orders
1. Fill ask orders
1. Cancel bid order
1. Cancel ask order
1. Settle the pending trades

## Exchange Roles

The [`ExchangeRoles`](../contracts/ExchangeRoles.sol) contract contains the entry rules for maker membership. Since with the correct strategy, makers could gain profits from providing liquidity in Tranchess Exchange, we enforce an exclusive maker membership that requires a substantial amount of vote-locked `Chess` token and expires naturally as the vote-locked `Chess` decreases linearly.

1. Query the status and expiration date of the current maker status
1. Apply for maker

# Contract Interactions

The flowcharts below demonstrate the interactions between either Secondary Market smart contracts, other Tranchess components, or external decentralized applications. The arrow represents execution context from the caller to callee within the EVM as a transaction is processed.

## Deposit/Withdraw

To receive rewards of governance token and participate in the secondary market, one should deposit tokenized shares into the corresponding `Exchange` contract.

### Deposit

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="./deposit_tx1.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;" width="500" />

1. Fund.convert(balanceP, balanceA, balanceB, version)
1. Fund: (return conversion result for available and locked balances)

1. ERC20Token(tranche).transfer(account, amount)

## Placing an order

Bid and ask orders are created by makers to either buy or sell shares of Tranche P/A/B for the USD stablecoin. For each order placed, the maker is asked to provide the amount, PD level, conversion ID, and a custom order ID of the order. The order book is using a link list implementation and arranges all orders by PD levels (premium-discount level), which is ranged from 0 (-10%) to 80 (-10%) with a step size of 0.25%. Makers are also asked to lock up the equal value of USD stablecoin or shares based on the amount and the PD level of the order.
